                    Led the end-to-end product design process, from research and competitor analysis to system design and testing:
                        1. Conducted competitor analysis on existing AI interview tools
                        2. Collaborated with two designers to create a shared design system in Figma
                        3. Designed and iterated through three rounds of high-fidelity prototypes
                        4. Validated usability through user testing and surveys

        <p>Many learners practice interviews alone or through static question banks.
        They often receive no feedback on language use, tone, or communication

        <h2>User research: summary</h2>
        <p>I conducted a competitor analysis of leading study and learning platforms like Quizlet, 
            Brainscape, and Khan Academy to understand the current offerings in educational tools. 
            The analysis revealed critical gaps in how interview practice platforms address language 
            feedback and real-time performance tracking.
            Key Takeaways:
            1. Focus on Depth & Customization: Unlike Quizlet and Brainscape, 
            Reality AI Lab (formerly Radical AI) provides real-time performance metrics such as repeated words, strong/weak word usage, and pauses.
            2. Practical Use of Feedback: Our tool goes beyond memorization and ensures users get actionable 
            feedback on language clarity, which platforms like Quizlet don’t fully address.
            3. Personalized Progress: The emphasis on interview-specific feedback in Reality AI Lab (formerly Radical AI) makes it unique 
            compared to general-purpose learning apps like Khan Academy.

                    presented as graphs and charts. Additionally, the “Good Job” and “Need Improvement” visual cues directly addressed users’ need for 
                    gamified, motivational feedback. This feature mirrors competitive ranking, similar to Quizlet’s match mode, but with deeper contextual 
                    relevance, such as progress in behavioral, technical, and situational question categories.

        <h3>User-Centered Design Drives Success</h3>
        <p>The emphasis on user feedback was crucial throughout the design process. Engaging with participants early and often ensured that every design decision was grounded in real user needs and expectations. 
            By focusing on user satisfaction (92%) and understanding how real-time feedback and progress tracking impacted their confidence, 
            I learned how to prioritize features that resonate with users. In the future, continuous feedback and usability testing would be a key strategy for validating and 
            iterating on designs before launch.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <h3>Balance Between Functionality and Emotional Experience</h3>
        <p>The emotional aspect of the user experience was just as important as the functionality. Creating a platform that feels supportive, motivational, and encouraging helped users feel more comfortable 
            and confident while interacting with AI. This balanced approach, where data-driven feedback is paired with an empathetic tone, was critical in making the platform feel like a coaching tool rather 
            than a cold, impersonal evaluator. Moving forward, I’ll continue to focus on the emotional side of UX design, especially when working on AI-driven platforms, where user trust and engagement are key.
