        <p>People arrive at the movie
          theatre late but still want
          snacks without going through
          waiting in line to order or people
          want theatre’s food to be ordered and
          delivered elsewhere.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <h2>The goal</h2>
        <p>Design an app for the movie theatre that
          allows users to easily order snacks and schedule
          a pickup or delivery without accessibility issues.

        <p>I conducted interviews and created
          empathy maps to understand the users
          I’m designing for and their needs.
          A primary user group identified through
          research was busy working adults who arrive
          at the movie theatre late.
          This user group confirmed initial assumptions
          about the movie theatre’s customers, but research
          also revealed that waiting time to order and pick up
          snacks was not the only factor preventing users to order
          snacks from the theatre in person. Other user problems
          included accessibility issues (visual impairment,
          language barrier, etc).

        <p>I conducted unmoderated usability testing with 7
          participants of various ages and
          residences. The goal is to investigate what specific
          difficulties users encounter when they try to
          complete the core tasks of Movfood: item selection, ordering,
          and in-app navigation. I chose the unmoderated
          testing method since it is less prone
          to bias, and the observer effect--individuals' acting
          differently when they are aware that
          they are being watched--does not apply.
          Here are a research plan
          containing a list of prompts.

          that the participant can't tell the difference between "current location"
          and "enter location". In fact, this is a common pain point among all participants.
          This reveals that the initial design of scheduling a delivery page is not intuitive.

        <p>Impact: The app makes users feel like the movie theatre really thinks
          about how to meet their needs.
          One quote from peer feedback: “The app made it so easy and
          fast to order snacks and schedule a delivery! I would
          definitely use this app instead of ordering snacks in-person.
          I would also like to order a delivery to home when I crave movie snacks.”

          What I learned: While designing Movfood,
          I learned that the first ideas for the app are only the
          beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback
          influenced each iteration of the app’s designs.
