        <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and their needs. A
          primary user group identified through research was busy parents selecting an elementary and/or secondary
          school out of all schools for their children. This
          user group confirmed initial assumptions about the service’s customers, but research also revealed that
          excessive time spent gathering the same set of information from each school’s website was not the only users
          pain point. Other user problems included accessibility
          issues (visual impairment, language barrier, etc) and an incomplete list of schools to select from.

        <p>Impact:
          A study participant stated that “I would definitely use
          this to find a school. It’s so easy and fast to find the
          same set of indicators and information for all schools.
          All the information I look for is presented too.”

        <p>What I learned:
          While designing the responsive website, I learned that the
          first ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process.
          Usability studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration
          of the app’s designs.
